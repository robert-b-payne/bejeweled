<h1>React Bejeweled</h1>

This web app is currently being developed. The core functionality of the game works (game logic, animations). 

I plan on adding scoring, a timer, a hint button, and a reset button. The game will start out with X possible moves and later in the game if there are no possible moves, the game will randomly generate new gems. Also, the game won't start out with gems matching each other right off the bat.
